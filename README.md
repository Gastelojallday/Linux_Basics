# Linux_Basics

Hello Future Linux GURU's!!!! I am just a beginner like you, trying to figure this thing out! I found great pleasure creating this markdown. I have read the compTIA Linux+ and created notes for every chapter of this book. I did the best I can and I will continue to update this as new material comes out! I feel for me, this will be the way I will master Linux...Sharing it to the WORLD!
